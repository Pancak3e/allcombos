# allcombos
A Python script that creates all possible alphanumerical and symbol combinations in string format for URL Fuzzing.

While I was working on a excersise on Pentesterlab, I needed a list of URL Fuzzing possibilities that varied between A0 and 9F
I did some googling and found two seperate tutorial scripts that I merged together and tweaked, those were used to make this.

This script has been very useful to me, and its quite flexiable as well, you can add almost anything to it as its currently written.
I hope others find this useful as well.

Fuzz The Planet!
